## `Installation`

Save projects Folder Locally then open it through VS Code and open the terminal and type: "npm install" and once the node-modules have been installed type npm start to run the server.
You will notice a message written on the terminal with the link to where the server is running. By clicking on the [local host link](http://localhost:8080/api) essentially you'll be making the GET HTTP request to be able to read the contents in the projects JSON file.
