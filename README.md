When you click the play button on the info page or the home page the the
game starts and the count down starts. The main objective is to click on
the cards that match to reveal the cards. You will have 100 seconds to reveal
all the cards on the page.

If you reveal all the cards before the countdown timer reaches 0 then
you win and the alert pops up! However if you fail to match the cards within the time allocated you lose the game
and another alert pops up
